## Synopsis

A browser-based version of [Jotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotto) that supports human v. computer and human v. human games.

## Motivation

This project is intended as a playground for an ASP.NET- and SignalR-based version of the game.  The UI is intentionally quick-n-dirty, with emphasis only on functionality and none on aesthetics.
